        We want our agents to get smarter over time through interacting with us - remembering goals, instructions, corrections, our preferences, etc.

        This kind of long term memory is when you really start to take your agents to the next level of personalization and human like behavior. In this video, Iâ€™ll show you step by step how to build these self-learning AI agents using an open source Python library called Mem0 which is specifically built for this purpose.
